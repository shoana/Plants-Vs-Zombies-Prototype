Plants vs. Zombies
Milestone 1: A text-based (i.e., console-based input and textual representation), bare- bones but playable version of the game (sunflowers, one other type of plant, one type of zombie, just one level), UML modeling of the problem domain (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, complete variable and method signatures)
