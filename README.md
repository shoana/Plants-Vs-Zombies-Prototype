# SYSC3310_Group6_PvZ

Known bugs:
- Zombies start from the 2nd rightmost grid space, not the furthest right grid space.
- Zombies and Plants sometimes disappear from the board and reappear when the user takes another turn
- Undo/Redo is late (changes are only reflected when the user takes another turn)
