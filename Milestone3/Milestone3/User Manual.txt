USER MANUAL:
-------------------
Inorder for the game to begin, run the View.java class. 
1) You have a current score of 1000 sunshines
2) Start by choosing a position on the board by pressing a button on the grid. 
3) A pop-up will appear for you to choose the type of plant that you would like to place on the 6 by 6 grid
   ex.  if you would like to plant a sunflower (50 sunshines), click on the Sunflower button to place the plant you purchased. -- If you chose to plant a sunflower you will be asked if you would like to collect the sun to get 25 sunshines.
   ex. if you would like to place a plantshooter (100 sunshines), click on the Plantshooter button to place the plant you purchased. Same follows for the rest of the plants (yes cherry and walnut are plants in this case)
4) A 'p' is placed for a Peashooter,  's' is placed in the position of the Sunflower, 'c' in the palce of a Cherry Bomb and 'w' is placed in the place of a Walnut. *
5) The zombies **, noted with 'z' , 'x' and 'f' start to creep up as you place your plants. Try to strategically place your peashooters to kill the zombies. Plant sunflowers to collect suns to purchase more plants. (One sunflower produces one sun worth 25 sunshines)
6) Zombies begin at the end of the board (rightmost positon). After each turn (planting), zombies will move forward. Make sure you are placing your plants so that the zombies cannot reach the house or eat the plants. 
7) You have the ability to undo or redo any of your steps like placing and replacing the plants. But do not count on redoing the zombies, because they have a mind of their own. 
8) If the zombies reach the house then the zombies will win. If the zombies eat all of the plants and no plants are on the grid, the zombies will also win. Lastly, if you use all your sunshine and can not plant anymore plants onto the grid, the zombies can win that way too.
9) For the plants to win, you must defeat all the zombies and still have sunshine leftover. 
10) Place plants strategically and try not to get killed!
